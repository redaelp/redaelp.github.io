            <p>The city of El Paso has brought to the downtown area eighteen new wayfinding kiosks which will serve as a guide for the citizens. They will point the way to retail areas, art museums, government districsts, and restaurants. Currently, there are eleven kiosks all around downtown and the remaining seven are still in storage waiting to be installed after several construction projects are completed.</p>
            <p>These kiosks come in two sizes, some nine feet tall and others are twelve feet tall with canopies and overhead lighting. These taller kiosks will be near locations such as the Convention Center, the El Paso Museum of Art, the El Paso Museum of History, and the El Paso County Courthouse. The kiosks are electric or solar powered and serve as a map that emphasizes the five major areas of downtown: Union Plaza, arts, shopping, government, and office. The information on these kiosks is available both in English and in Spanish.</p>
            <p>This project is a partnership between the city of El Paso and the Downtown Management District. It cost an estimated $287,949 that was funded through the Quality of Life Bond 2012. This project was created by an Austin-based company run by Steven Stamper who has also created other wayfinding kiosks for various cities across Texas. Their main inspiration for the design of these kiosks was the Mexican Papel Picado designs, Mexican art, and what they saw when they came to El Paso. This project has taken approximately four years to complete due to the large amount of reconstruction in the downtown area.</p>
            <p>These new kiosks are a great way of getting information to not only tourists but also to the citizens of El Paso. They will help direct locals during many of the events held downtown such as Chalk the Block and Neon Desert Music Festival. It is a great new start for the downtown renovations and a way of demonstrating the potential that the city of El Paso has to grow and expand.</p>
