            <p>In my global business class we had a guest speaker, Dr. Franklin, come an talk to us about the Peace Corps volunteer program. This volunteer program is a twenty-seven month long service and during this time you spend three months in technical and culture training. The part that really caught my attention is that it is a paid volunteer program and you get thirty days of vacation besides holidays. Volunteers serve in sixty-five countries such as South Africa, Bolivia, and the Dominican Republic. The work areas are education, health, environment, business, agriculture, and many others. In the volunteer program there are benefits after your return such as scholarships for continuing your education and advancing in your career. Another positive outcome of these volunteer programs is that return volunteers have a non-competitive eligibility for federal jobs for a certain period of time. The best benefit that you would receive after entering the Peace Corps is the experience that you get which will help you in any career along with the fact that you can discover new places and make a difference.</p>
            <p>For more information about the program you can contact April Rumgay, Peace Corps Student Assistant at (915) 747-6500. You can also visit the UTEP web page for more information at www.peacecorps.utep.edu.</p>
