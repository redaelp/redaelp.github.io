            <p>The city of El Paso has continued to grow and expand within its boundaries at a very past rate over the past fourteen years. El Paso is now ranked the 19th largest city in the U.S. with a population of 674,433. Its population is now taking into consideration the significant growth at Fort Bliss. To many outsiders, it may just seem like a small, desert town but its borders certainly expand even further than what appears on any map. Three main factors that can account for the economic growth of El Paso are the national economy, the economy of Ciudad, Juarez, and the continuous expansion of Fort Bliss.</p>
            <p>El Paso has plenty of land that can produce a greater benefit and more profit when it is developed efficiently. Developers in the area are working to create neighborhood focus centers and destinations with more retail, entertainment, and services for residents. This type of development advancement allows for more productive transit, more destinations within walking distance of neighborhoods, and more opportunities for small business and bright entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p>Being located right next to Mexico is another very advantageous attribute that has led to the city's growth. In an ideal development, El Paso and Juarez would operate as a single international city with borders outside of the cities edges. Free travel of people, goods, and services would happen between the two cities and in that way increase local economic efficiency. Although this is not the case, the current situation is very similar to this one and it creates a unique target for businesses and even tourists as a city that embodies two nations.</p>
            <p>Fort Bliss is an important key factor in the expansion of the local economy in many ways. For one, its growth and expansion adds to the overall population and therefore more housing and spending is present. Because El Paso is located at a central point for shipping and distribution, there is an efficient technology transfer from any research and development associated with Fort Bliss. This leads to the distribution of other finished goods and products into our area.</p>
            <p>This increase in size is not going to stop here. According to the Borderplex Alliance, between 2000 and 2040, the population of El Paso County is projected to grow by 69.7 percent. Much of this growth will be due to the factors listed above along with the large amount of cultural diversity that attracts a wide array of people. Without a doubt, it is important to focus on the positive aspects that El Paso has instead of otherwise because it is through this positive mentality that we will attract more improvements. El Paso has so much more to offer now in comparison to the past and residents should take advantage of the new opportunities that are coming to the borderland. All of these increases and expansions have been a great boost for the economy of El Paso and even the United States as a whole.</p>
