            <p>For many locals, the Fountains have been a new and exciting place to shop for anything from high-tech computers at Best Buy to trendy clothes at Altar'd State. Although many have complained that there are new many empty buildings in the new shopping center, new additions such as La Madeline Cafe and HomeGoods have brought some distinct appeal to the borderland. Beyond the retail spaces and eateries, the Fountains has also given El Pasoan's a new place to spend time together and enjoy the arts.</p>
            <p>The Fountains Promenade Main Lawn and Amphitheater is a very intimate venue that has hosted many exciting events since the opening of the mall. Fashion shows, local artist concerts, yoga on the lawn, and movie screenings are just a few free events hosted by the Fountains. The environment of the amphitheater inspires El Pasoans who attend these events to begin living life outside of the box.</p>
            <p>One of their recent events that was held in early September was a short film festival titled "Only in El Paso." This event featured ten short films that showcased the talent of local filmmakers as they captured what they felt made El Paso such a unique and beautiful place to live. One of our very own UTEP professors made a film about the haunted locations in El Paso and another filmmaker gave the viewers an inside look at the El Paso legend Jay J. Armes.</p>
            <p>These films not only entertained the crowd of people that attended but they provided this city with a glimpse of all that we have to offer. Many people may say that our city has no talent, fun, or excitement but all ten of these short films contested that view in the best way possible. This film series did not stop after this event, the films can still be viewed via the link posted below and preparations for next years "Only in El Paso" film series is already underway. http://kcostv.org/ourcommunity/onlyinelpaso.php</p>
