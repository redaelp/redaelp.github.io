            <p>A company that is barely nine months old is thriving in a city full of creepy crawlers and pesky animals. With many critters ranging from spiders to foxes in our area, its no wonder Fulcrum Pest Control is the fastest growing company in El Paso at the moment. Located on the far Westside, Fulcrum is committed to giving their customers the best quality service at the most affordable prices. I sat down and interviewed Co-Founder, James Sullivan, and VP in Sales, Scott Wyman, at UTEP's semi-annual career fair on February 5.</p>
            <p>When asked when he discovered he wanted to be an entrepreneur, Mr. Sullivan said that he gathered his interest during his junior year of college. His first window of opportunity for entrepreneurship came when he was a sophomore and he first began working for a pest control company. Although he started this job with no desire to go his own way, he took what he learned from this previous situation and has achieved great success because of it.</p>
            <p>According to Sullivan, some barriers an aspiring entrepreneur might face would be self-doubt and lack of faith or confidence in oneself. His advice to those who aspire to open their own business was, "Believe in yourself and don't fear failure. You are your own worst enemy and your biggest competition". One of the hardest parts about being an entrepreneur is the fact that you are entering the unknown and you have to be prepared for what lies ahead. Moving out of your comfort zone can be challenging, but if you work hard and stay positive success is easily attainable. Just as Mr. Wyman told me, "You get in what you put out," and if you are willing to put in the work then maybe someday you too can know how it feels to be the fastest growing company in the El Paso area.</p>
