            <p>I saw my world flash before my eyes as it happened. Things were rushing by and the madness was ensuing with no clear end in sight. Event tickets have a way of making everyone who wants one lose their minds and I was no exception. The band Paramore is coming to town and I could not be more ecstatic. I know I was not alone when I said in that moment, "There are only a few things that I would not do to get a ticket for this!"</p>
            <p>The rate at which the tickets were being sold was a clear indication that these tickets were going by the masses. In a matter of hours, the last of the tickets had been sold, but by the power of the concert gods, I got my ticket! There are probably many others in the city that are as excited as I am. Seeing all of this craziness was an eye-opening experience.</p>
            <p>It is a great occurrence in El Paso when something like this happens. Obviously, there are tons of people wanting tickets, and the local econom is not complaining. The last time Paramore came to El Paso, the concert did not sell out, which was not as successful of a turnout that the event planners had hoped for. Despite this, the band has chosen to return to El Paso and this time their event is completely sold out. As far as the ticket sales and fan response is concerned, things could not be better. I will wait to see at the concert if they have the same luck with merchandise sales as well.</p>
