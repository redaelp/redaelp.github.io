            <p>In the past couple of months, oil prices have plummeted due to several factors. Surprisingly, one of the main reasons that the United States is the number one producer of oil! Good old fashion supply and demand has caused the prices to go down on a barrel of oil. According to the Economist, "Oil prices have fallen more than 40 percent since June, when it was $115 a barrel. It is not at $70 a barrel." This article was published in December 2014, but since then, things have changed slightly.</p>
            <p>As prices were falling on oil, gas prices fell all over the U.S. which made many motorists very happy. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays a big role in controlling the supply of oil to many countries. It is simple economics, you reduce the supply which creates more demand. As oil prices were falling the media reported that OPEC had decided not to restrict supply. OPEC and Non-OPEC producers are increasing production which in turn creates more supply. Many would question why they came about doing this.</p>
            <p>It can be speculated that by increasing supply, the oil prices will continue to fall, that will in turn cause oil companies to continue to lose more and more money. If oil companies lose money then they will stop investing in machinery which would slow production in the future and cause prices to go up again. Is OPEC allowing lower prices now so that in the future they can control supply and thus be number one in oil production once again? Another point of view that has been reported is that perhaps if OPEC did cut its supply that another company will simply pick up the order. So cutting up supply in one country means an increase in demand from anotehr country.</p>
            <p>So as some rejoice because of the lower prices on gas, others will soon begin to feel the effect. Countries whose primary source of income is oil will begin to face political issues and economic downturn. It is an interesting issue to examine because it seems that there is no "win-win" situation. Is OPEC plotting to dominate the oil industry in the future? What impact will this have on the U.S. economy? What effect will this have globally? This issue is definitely something to keep an eye on.</p>
            <p>Latest Update 2/26/15: There is talk about OPEC increasing supply so we shall see what is in store.</p>
