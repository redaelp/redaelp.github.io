        <div id="content">
            <p>Every year for the past seven years, El Pasoans have had the opportunity of enjoying a totally free and completely creative art exhibit that works beyond the four walls of any building. Chalk the Block is a local and national art showcase that allows artists from all disciplines to put their work on sidewalk display for the thousands of people that attend. Not only does this give people something to do on the weekend but also allows the artists to hone their talents in a completely new environment.</p>
            <p>Not many artists that I know have found their medium of interest to be in chalk drawing on a sidewalk but this unique aspect of the event is what proves just how talented each of them really is. As a previous attendee of the event I can vouch for the beauty and complexity of each of the works and the environment that engulfs downtown El Paso is unlike any other. With food trucks, local band concerts, and abstract performances occurring throughout the time of the event, our city is truly becoming a beacon of small business and community involvment.</p>
            <p>It is events such as this one that bring optimism to the people and enthusiasm to the borderland as we experience the bigger and better things that are happening in our region. People of all ages will enjoy this event and there is not one person who will not find enjoyment in the many activities that are planned. Taking place October 10-12, Chalk the Block will bring a new wave of excitement to the borderland and all who attend will not be disappointed.</p>
