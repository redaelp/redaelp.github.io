            <p>On January 31, 2015, a local event took place for the second year in a row. The Chocolate Affair is and will no doubt continue to be a great place for anyone to go and satisfy their sweet tooth as well as learn about some great businesses in El Paso. This event was held at the Fountains at Farah and tickets were fifteen dollars prior to the event and twenty dollars at the door. Going to this event was a great way for El Pasoans to explore what more is out there in the market as far as desserts and savory creations are concerned.There were also other treats being given ot at the event that were not chocolate such as cakes, dipped treats, and strawberries.</p>
            <p>This event was a chance for many not so well-known stores and vendors to become more popular in El Paso's economy. Going to the event undoubtedly helped all stores and vendors that participated get a leg up on the competition. Vendors got the chance to speak to potential customers as well as plan out future business deals. Any store in the dessert business acquired a significant economic advantage by attending.</p>
            <p>This was a well-attended event that benefited everyone there. Hopefully, this event will continue to flourish for many years to come. If not just to be more in-the-know about what new dessert options you have in the area, a Chocolate Affair is a great way to get out and enjoy great food all while having a good time.</p>
