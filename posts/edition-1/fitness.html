            <p>Getting fit has now become easier for the people of El Paso with the help of LiveFitEP. New You Gym and their partnership with the city of El Paso have initiated a new fitness movement called LiveFitEP. This movement helps to make it easier for the citizens of El Paso to live a healthier lifestyle by the means of exercise and healthier eating habits. Recently we had the pleasure of interviewing Kimberly Rayner, a fitness trainer from New You Gym, in which she told us about what inspired this movement along with their future goals for the city of El Paso.</p>
            <p>"This movement was inspired by the Oklahoma Movement. New You Gym owners, Shane and Lizzie Martinez wanted to bring this movement to El Paso," Rayner said. The Oklahoma Movement was created as a way to help their people start losing weight because at that current time the obesity rate in the state was very high. They measured this through an app which calculated the city's weight loss as a whole, something that LiveFitEP is looking to recreate to measure the overall weight loss of the people in our city. "El Paso is one of the fattest cities in the country. This is mostly because the people of El Paso are so uneducated when it comes to our health; that is why we are making it one of our goals to change this with the LiveFitEP movement."</p>
            <p>Restaurants such as Barrigas, Corralitos, and Carnitas Queretaro have joined the movement. Rayner said, "People need to understand that a healthy lifestyle begins in the kitchen, not just with exercise." At each of these restaurants you are now able to find an inserted menu with "New You Approved" on it. These menus will include healthier options that still seek to satisfy, going against the popular belief that healthy food cannot taste good.</p>
            <p>Not only is eating healthy an important component of this movement, but New You and LiveFitEP has incorporated multiple fitness boot camps, free fitness nutrition classes, and even Stadium Sundays where anyone who is looking for new ways to exercise can join. As for the future, LiveFitEP's goals include spreading to other cities across Texas and eventually to the rest of the country.
