            <p>On May 20th through the 31st, one of Broadway’s most popular shows will come to El Paso: Wicked. Based off the famous book, Wicked is now a well-known musical that more El Pasoans will be lining up to see it and buy tickets. Other times that Wicked has come to El Paso, not many people had been familiar with the story or its popularity, at least here in El Paso. However, this musical has gained more El Pasoan fans since Wicked’s last stop in the Sun City and has a bigger El Paso fan base than ever before, which will undoubtedly keep growing.</p>
            <p>Especially with Mother’s Day right around the corner, this musical is what many people are looking forward to seeing. Its popularity threatens fans to run out of tickets before they can get them, even though they run relatively expensive. Center orchestra tickets cost anywhere from $70 to $139 per ticket. All other sections are around $70 per ticket also. This Broadway show is a great way to get involved in things going on in El Paso, and to get more people to participate and attend other fine arts activities here. The more stimulation to our economy, the more acts will want to stop here and there will always be something to watch or do.</p>
