            <p>History will be made in the borderland as Pope Francis concludes his Mexican tour with a visit to Ciudad Juarez. 
            On February 17th, the Pontiff will hold a mass in El Paso’s sister city, and members of the community want to make this
            first-ever visit as impactful as they can. Pope Francis is an icon to many people in the region and his presence will 
            bring light to the reality of life at the border. In a region where many people struggle with socioeconomic distress,
            people of all backgrounds can look at the Pope’s visit as a positive thing for the community. Because of this, the 
            business people of El Paso have shown great dedication and generosity. </p>
            <p>The Catholic Diocese of El Paso is working with the Catholic Diocese of Juarez to broadcast the event to American 
            viewers at the Sun Bowl. They want to bring Francis’ message of service and economic equality to all the diverse residents
            of the region. Janine Young is the Chief Operating Officer at the Foundation for the diocese, which has been given six weeks
            to raise money to pay for the broadcast. Working tirelessly, the staff has been raising every dollar they can through various
            methods. </p>
            <p>Mrs. Young said the organization’s goal is to raise $700,000 for the Sun Bowl rental.  A commemorative magazine of Pope Francis 
            is being developed by the foundation and they plan to make 15,000 copies to sell to spectators at the football stadium. The magazine 
            will feature information about the Pope and his visit, and will be sold for five dollars each. Sponsors of the publication include Fred 
            Loya Insurance, Ardovino’s, and Famous Dave's. Bishop Mark J. Seitz also called for parishes in the city to make second collections for 
            the event, which rose over $73,000 alone.</p>
            <p>The staff also receives donations from regional businesses, which have amounted to more than $100,000. Grants assistant Belen Gonzalez
            has worked to raise $20,000 herself in the past two weeks. Even churches across the Southwest have given support to this historic effort. 
            The Catholic Diocese of Phoenix, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, and Lubbock have collectively given an additional $150,000 to the foundation.
            It seems clear that people in El Paso and beyond do regard their community and do believe that this event can make a difference.</p>
            <p>Although the Foundation for the Diocese of El Paso seems to currently be in overdrive, it works very hard year round to benefit the El Paso Community. 
            It lives up to its message of servitude by operating homes for refugees fleeing the great violence in Mexico. It has programs that assist
            immigrants in finding work and working to gain documentation. Many schools that were once too old to function have been revitalized thanks 
            to the support from business owners. The El Paso business community has been terrific in helping the Diocese and other great organizations
            make life better for thousands in the city.</p>
