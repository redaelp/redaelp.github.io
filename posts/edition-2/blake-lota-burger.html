            <p>Blake’s LOTA Burger started in Albuquerque, New Mexico on July 9th, 1952 as a small business such as many do. 
            The difference was that LOTA Burger did not end up closing its doors, but prospered and became a great hit as locals 
            could not get enough of it. The owner Blake Chanslor realized he had an immense opportunity to expand his business.
            Now after 63 years LOTA Burger has approximately 90 locations most of them located across New Mexico, Arizona, 
            and El Paso. </p>
            <p>One of the main reasons Blake’s LOTA Burger has become successful and has been able to expand, and is now capable 
            of competing against corporate giants is due to LOTA Burgers commitment to using high quality products as well as 
            producing great tasting burgers. By having LOTA Burger achieve consistent quality it has allowed the restaurant to 
            thrive and reach new heights. </p>
            <p>Blake’s LOTA Burger has two existing restaurants located in El Paso, Texas. The first one located on 7017 N Mesa St. 
            and the second one on 12371 Edgemere Blvd, but another one is emerging in the local community of El Paso on 7122 Gateway 
            East Blvd. Blake’s LOTA Burger is expanding its way to El Paso by incorporating its restaurants throughout the city and 
            opening a new one to share its unique style of quality products with it the El Paso community. Also LOTA Burger has enhanced 
            the city’s variety of food choices between the public, and has set a trend that can influence other fast-food restaurants to 
            establish their business and add to the border city’s mixed culture. </p>
