            <p>People of El Paso have been waiting for this time of year for months now: the start of baseball seasons for the El Paso Chihuahuas! Last baseball season was the first ever for the Chihuahuas, and they really came through for the El Paso area. This was at the same time that the new baseball stadium was built in El Paso. Everyone in town knew about the activities going on downtown that could now happen much more frequently thanks to the baseball players that made it come to life.</p>
            <p>The baseball stadium and the Chihuahuas players have sparked the excitement in the city ever since the idea started being worked on. The stadium provides the people of El Paso with casual every day entertainment, and provides the city with a fast, simple way to stimulate the economy. Being able to do different things at the stadium while the game is going on is probably the best part about going. There is something for everyone! From the beginning stages when the city and all of its members were voting on a mascot animal to today that all of the people of El Paso cannot wait to spend the day with their family watching Americaâ€™s sport in their hometown, El Paso and the Chihuahuas make the perfect pair.</p>
